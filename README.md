## Introduction

As a software engineer, proficiency in data structures and algorithms is crucial for solving complex problems efficiently. This repository serves as a practice ground, where I implement solutions to various problems and document my thought process and approach.

## Problems

The problems are organized into different directories based on their categories, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc. Each problem directory contains the following files:

- `basicPython.ipynb`: A description of the problem statement.
<!-- - `solution.py`: The Python implementation of the solution.
- `explanation.md`: An explanation of the thought process, time and space complexity analysis, and any additional notes. -->

## Usage

To run the solutions for a specific problem, navigate to the respective problem directory and execute the code block below the respective markdown block in file using Python kernal.
Some solutions may require additional input or have specific instructions, which can be understood by the code in the respective file.

## Contributing
